# RADAR The VK Users Parser
So, mainly this set of scripts (since i didn't bother to compile this in one script) </br>
Were used to find myself a significant other :) </br>
It even successed! So i want to share it in case someone stumbles upon this script </br>
It gets users from your groups, filters them, gets matches by groups and a little GUI to display them </br>
# Usage
- Install some dependencies from requirements.txt 
- Get yourself some VK accounts (1 will suffice, but the more the merrier and lower chance of ban)
- Get tokens either as VkAdmin [DO NOT SHARE THIS TOKEN ANYWHERE](https://oauth.vk.com/authorize?client_id=6121396&scope=1&redirect_uri=https://oauth.vk.com/blank.html&display=page&response_type=token&revoke=1)</br>
or as Kate Mobile [AGAIN, DO NOT SHARE THESE TOKENS](https://oauth.vk.com/authorize?client_id=2685278&scope=1073737727&redirect_uri=https://api.vk.com/blank.html&display=page&response_type=token&revoke=1)
- Fill sample_config.cfg with tokens, names for bots of your choice, and your id (your groups will be parsed for users), then rename it to config.cfg
- Finally open and follow tutorial.txt
# Best of luck on your journey!
